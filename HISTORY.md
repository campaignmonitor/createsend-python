# createsend-python history

* Fix bug where the six module was not set as a installation dependency.
* Remove relative imports.
* Improve Python 3 support.
* Use PEP 8 formatting.
* See [#43](https://github.com/campaignmonitor/createsend-python/pull/43) for details.

## v4.2.1 - 19 Dec, 2016

* Decode JSON API responses using UTF-8: ([#38](https://github.com/campaignmonitor/createsend-python/pull/38))

## v4.2.0 - 10 Oct, 2016

* Support Python 3: ([#27](https://github.com/campaignmonitor/createsend-python/pull/27))
* Use CGI SERVER_NAME in UA string: ([#32](https://github.com/campaignmonitor/createsend-python/pull/32))

## v4.1.1 - 7 Aug, 2015

* Fixed the MANIFEST file so that it includes new Transactional files (#25).

## v4.1.0 - 4 Aug, 2015

* Added support for Transactional Email

## v4.0.0 - 19 Feb, 2014

* Removed `CreateSend.apikey` to promote using OAuth rather than basic auth with an API key.
* Started using the `https://api.createsend.com/api/v3.1/` API endpoint.
* Added support for new segments structure.
  * Segments now includes a new `RuleGroups` member, instead of a `Rules` member.

    So for example, when you _previously_ would have created a segment like so:

    ```python
    segment.create(list.ListID, 'Python API Segment', [ { "Subject": "EmailAddress", "Clauses": ["CONTAINS pyapi.com"] } ])
    ```

    You would _now_ do this:

    ```python
    segment.create(list.ListID, 'Python API Segment', [ { "Rules": [ { "RuleType": "EmailAddress", "Clause": "CONTAINS pyapi.com" } ] } ])
    ```

  * The Add Rule call is now Add Rule Group, taking a `rulegroup` argument instead of a `subject` & `clauses` argument.

    ```python
    Segment.add_rulegroup(self, rulegroup):
    ```

    So for example, when you _previously_ would have added a rule like so:

    ```python
    segment.add_rule( "EmailAddress", ["CONTAINS pyapi.com"] )
    ```

    You would _now_ do this:

    ```python
    segment.add_rulegroup( { "Rules": [ { "RuleType": "EmailAddress", "Clause": "CONTAINS pyapi.com" } ] } )
    ```

## v3.4.0 - 25 Jan, 2014

* Modified several methods so that unnecessary arguments are no longer needed.

  The following methods were updated:
  - `Administrator.get()`
  - `Person.get()`
  - `Subscriber.get()`

  As an example using, previously you would write:

  ```python
  subscriber = Subscriber(auth, 'listid', 'me@test.com').get('listid', 'me@test.com')
  ```

  Now you can write:

  ```python
  subscriber = Subscriber(auth, 'listid', 'me@test.com').get()
  ```

## v3.3.0 - 13 Jul, 2013

* Added support for validating SSL certificates to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.

## v3.2.0 - 16 May, 2013

* Added Python version and platform details to default user agent string.
* Added support for setting a custom user agent string.

  You can set a custom user agent string to be used for API calls by doing the following:

  ```python
  CreateSend.user_agent = "custom user agent"
  ```

## v3.1.0 - 15 Apr, 2013

* Added support for [single sign on](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/account/#single_sign_on) which allows initiation of external login sessions to Campaign Monitor.

## v3.0.0 - 25 Mar, 2013

* Added support for authenticating using OAuth. See the [README](README.md#authenticating) for full usage instructions.
* Refactored authentication so that it is _always_ done at the instance level. This introduces some breaking changes, which are clearly explained below.
  * Authentication is now _always_ done at the instance level.

      So when you _previously_ would have authenticated using an API key as follows:

      ```python
      CreateSend.api_key = 'your_api_key'
      cs = CreateSend()
      clients = cs.clients()
      ```

      If you want to authenticate using an API key, you should _now_ do this:

      ```python
      cs = CreateSend({'api_key': 'your_api_key'})
      clients = cs.clients()
      ```

  * Instances of any subclasses of `CreateSendBase` are now _always_ created by passing an `auth` hash as the first argument.

      So for example, when you _previously_ would have called `Client()` like so:

      ```python
      CreateSend.api_key 'your api key'
      cl = Client('your client id')
      ```

      You _now_ call `CreateSend::Client.new` like so:

      ```python
      auth = {'api_key': 'your api key'}
      cl = Client(auth, 'your client id')
      ```

## v2.6.0 - 17 Dec, 2012

* Created objects (clients, campaigns, lists, segments, and templates) now
retain identifiers they are given when created. This allows the following code
to be written:

  ```python
  client = Client()
  client.create("Company Name", "(GMT+10:00) Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney",
    "Australia")
  details = client.details()
  ```

  Previously, this code would have been written as follows:

  ```python
  client = Client()
  client_id = client.create("Company Name",
    "(GMT+10:00) Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney", "Australia")
  client.client_id = client_id
  details = client.details()
  ```
